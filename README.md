# Crypto forecaster
This project is meant to give you an idea of how much your crypto can be worth in a few years.

## How to use
1. Pick the crypto currency you own
2. Select how many coins you own
3. Pick which fiat currency to output prices in
4. The app will automatically calculate how much (arithmetic average) growth there have been in the last up to 10 years. This will appear after a few seconds. If you want to input your own growth rate, you can do that as well.
5. Select how many years in the future you want to look
6. If you have picked ADA, you can choose staking rewards as well (5 percent should be pretty accurate)
